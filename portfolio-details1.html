            <p>
              I have been working as a Frontend Developer in this company since Oct 2020. I am only one Frontend Developer in the IT team of oladoc.com who is developing and performing all Frontend Development activities and Performance Best Practices here.
              
              <ul style="list-style: inside;">
                <li>At oladoc.com, Pakistan's foremost online platform for Doctor appointments, Lab tests, and Medicine bookings, I led the implementation of pixel-perfect and cross-browser compatible frontend development. My efforts included performance enhancements that significantly elevated core web vitals. This strategic approach resulted in improved search engine rankings, fostering organic traffic growth and concurrently reducing advertising expenditures.</li>
                <li>I streamlined the project by eliminating Slick sliders and implementing a custom JavaScript solution with arrow binding. This initiative aimed to reduce the reliance on external JavaScript libraries, resulting in a more optimized and efficient system.</li>
                <li>I successfully transformed the design to a mobile-first approach, ensuring responsiveness across all screen sizes. This was achieved through the implementation of a custom grid system using flex and custom JavaScript, without relying on Bootstrap or any external JavaScript libraries. This strategic move not only enhances performance but also provides a tailored and efficient solution aligned with specific project requirements.</li>
                <li>I prioritize code optimization and redundancy reduction in UI development. Leveraging my proficiency in CSS, I ensure the creation of fully optimized code that guarantees responsiveness across all screen sizes. This approach not only enhances the overall performance but also reflects a commitment to delivering streamlined and efficient solutions in web development.</li>
                <li>I autonomously developed all pixel-perfect pages on oladoc.com within frameworks such as CodeIgniter and Laravel. This includes the home page, doctor listing pages, doctor profiles, hospital pages, procedure pages, labs, lab test pages, pharmacy pages, video consultation, and the entire appointment booking flow. My individual contributions ensure a cohesive and visually precise user experience across the platform's various sections.</li>
                <li>I took charge of developing the core UI components for the upload prescription, add to cart, and book appointment flow. This involved designing and implementing key features to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience in these critical areas of the platform.</li>
                <li>I successfully migrated Oladoc's My Practice module from CodeIgniter (CI) to Vue.js. This transition not only modernized the technology stack but also leveraged the capabilities of Vue.js to enhance the user interface and interactivity. The conversion aimed at optimizing performance and ensuring a more dynamic and efficient user experience.</li>
                <li>
                  I spearheaded the optimization efforts for Core Web Vitals performance across the entire oladoc.com platform, achieving a commendable score of 0 Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Furthermore, I substantially enhanced accessibility, best practices, and SEO metrics, surpassing a 90% benchmark.
                  <br>
                  In an ongoing capacity, I diligently manage on and off activities to sustain and continually improve the Core Web Vitals performance scores, ensuring an optimal and seamless user experience on oladoc.com.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I possess a robust understanding of UX/UI design principles and actively engage in UX/UI design activities at Oladoc. I have successfully led the design initiatives for the oladoc My Practice app, focusing on the treatment and procedure flow for the doctor's interface. Additionally, I've played a key role in designing the user experience for Lab Test, Pharmacy Medicines, Doctor Procedure pages, and the Medicine Add to Cart flows.
                  <br>
                  My designs, characterized by meticulous attention to detail, have undergone approval processes and were seamlessly implemented, subsequently deployed on production. I actively contribute to design discussions, providing valuable insights and suggestions to enhance user experience. This collaborative approach ensures that the design solutions align with industry best practices and result in optimal user engagement.
                </li>
                <li>
                
                  I possess expertise in Cypress frontend testing and have authored and executed various test cases for oladoc.com, including:
                  <ol style="padding-top:20px;">
                    <li>Comprehensive testing of the Login/Signup and Logout flow.</li>
                    <li>Thorough examination of the Doctor appointment booking process.</li>
                    <li>Rigorous testing of the Labs' prescription upload functionality.</li>
                    <li>Methodical verification of the Lab Test add-to-cart flow.</li>
                    <li>Evaluation of the Navbar functionality for both Desktop and Mobile interfaces.</li>
                    <li>These test cases contribute to ensuring the robustness and reliability of oladoc.com's frontend functionalities, demonstrating my commitment to quality assurance and seamless user experiences.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ul>
